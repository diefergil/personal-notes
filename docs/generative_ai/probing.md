# Using Probing Tasks to Train a Classifier with Foundational Models

## 1. Select a Foundational Model

Choose a foundational model suitable for your task, such as BERT or GPT,
 pre-trained on a large corpus.

## 2. Define Your Probing Task

Identify relevant features for your classification task and design a
 probing task to highlight these features.

## 3. Extract Representations

Generate embeddings from your dataset using the foundational model.

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Tokenize and generate embeddings
inputs = tokenizer("Your text input here", return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state
```

## 4. Apply a Probing Classifier

Train a lightweight classifier on the embeddings to map to your task's specific labels.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assuming `embeddings` is a 2D numpy array and `labels` is your target labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(embeddings, labels, test_size=0.2)

# Train a probing classifier
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the classifier
score = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {score}")
```

## 5. Fine-tuning (Optional)

Optionally, fine-tune the foundational model on your specific task for improved performance.

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    evaluate_during_training=True,
    logging_dir="./logs",
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset
)

trainer.train()
```

## 6.Deployment

Use the trained model for predictions on new, unseen data.

## Â Benefits and Considerations

* Efficiency: Saves time and resources by leveraging pre-trained models.
* Insightful: Offers insights into data features used for classification.
* Flexibility: Adaptable to various tasks by changing the probing task.

## Example Use Case

For a text classification task identifying toxic comments, generate
embeddings, design a probing task for toxicity features, and train a
linear classifier on these embeddings.
